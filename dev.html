It utilizes a custom algorithm to generate a random song ID which is passed into the Spotify API.  The information for that song is then returned to the user and allows them to preview the track to determine if they potentially like the song.  If they do, they can save the song to their account as well as navigate to the artists page on the Spotify website so that they can learn more about the artist, their releases, and upcoming shows.</em></p>

            <p>Hey there!  My name is Robert Cheeseman and I'm an Audio Engineer turned Software Developer.  I'm really drawn to Front End development as I thoroughly enjoy the creative aspect of watching a beautiful application/website come together from its inception all the way to finished product.  When I'm not working on coding or audio you can find me enjoying all sorts of outdoor activities that Colorado has to offer (Camping, hiking, snowboarding, rafting...) with my wife and our pup!  I've been playing in bands for over 20 years and have toured professionally both on the musician and crew side and have thus far been able to play music in 27 countries.  I have an extensive record collection (yes, vinyl!), enjoy traveling, and typically have a guitar or bass in my hands at least once a day.  Thanks for having a look over this portfolio, please feel free to reach out at any of the links to the right here! </p>
